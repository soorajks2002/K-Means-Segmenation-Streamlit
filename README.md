# Image Segmentation Using K-Means

## Description:
The Image Segmentation using K-Means Clustering project is a powerful tool that enables users to segment images into distinct regions or objects based on their pixel values and similarity. It harnesses the simplicity and effectiveness of K-Means clustering to provide an intuitive interface for image segmentation tasks.

## Key Features:

1. **Efficient Image Segmentation :** This tool leverages the K-Means clustering algorithm to efficiently group pixels in an image into clusters, producing distinct segments or regions.

2. **User-Friendly Interface :** The user interface is designed to be user-friendly and intuitive, allowing both beginners and experienced users to easily upload images and perform segmentation tasks.

3. **Cluster Customization :** Users can specify the number of clusters (K) they want to generate, allowing for fine-grained control over the segmentation process. Different values of K can yield varying levels of granularity in the segmented image.

4. **Visual Feedback :** The tool provides visual feedback by displaying the original image alongside the segmented result, making it easy for users to assess the quality and accuracy of the segmentation
